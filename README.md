# Analysing Movie Data

* I'll use a free API to extract the Movie Database that is most known as TMDb.
* This database has a tone of infos about movies, sitcoms and novels.
* It was created by Travis Bell in 2008 and it's constantly updated by it's community

## What I'll do?

* Data cleaning and preparation
* Analysis containing graphics (Data Visualisation)
* And also Machine Learning Models to cluster genres
